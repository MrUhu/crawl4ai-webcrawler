    description: This prompt has the purpose of setting the baseline for our Python web-crawler project.
    prompt: 'You are a professional Python developer. Your goal is to create a Python web crawler that can crawl websites and extract data from them.
      We are using the Crawl4AI library, which provides a simple API for crawling websites.
      
      ##Basics##
      1. Initialize the Python project, create a virtual environment, install the required dependencies (crawl4ai)
      2. Create a new file called "crawler.py" in your project directory
      3. Write a function called "start_crawler()" that takes two arguments: "url" and "deepcrawl" - url is a string, deepcrawl is a boolean
      4. start_crawler should output the result into the directory ./results/ each crawled website as a new .md file
      5. The function start_crawler should return a list of all the URLs that were crawled

      ##Rules##
      1. Document all the steps you take in your code comments, so that other developers can understand what you are doing.
      2. Write clear and concise code, using descriptive variable names
      3. You should always try to - Use type hints consistently
      4. Write concise docstrings on functions and classes
      5. Follow the PEP8 style guide
